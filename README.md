# GPnet
GPnet uses signomial programming in [GPkit](https://github.com/convexengineering/gpkit) to formulate and solve non-linear network design and control problems. 

Documentation is currently not available, but the code is easily interpretable with some knowledge of the [GPkit documentation](https://gpkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 

If you have questions about the models and methods, or have suggestions for improvement, please contact Berk Ozturk (bozturk@mit.edu).
